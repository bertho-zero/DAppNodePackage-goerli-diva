It is currently under development, running on Testnet.

There are now three endpoints in this package:

1. `http://diva.goerli-diva.public.dappnode:5050` is used for P2P communication.
2. `http://diva.goerli-diva.public.dappnode:30000` is used to access the API of your node, keep it open if you want to use the Operator UI.
3. `http://diva.goerli-diva.public.dappnode:8888` is used by the Operator UI.


When configuring the connection between the **Operator UI** and the API of your node the values are:
- Diva API URL: `http://diva.goerli-diva.public.dappnode:30000`
- Diva Auth Token: *YOUR_API_TOKEN*
